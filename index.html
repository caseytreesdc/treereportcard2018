                    on data collected from both public and private sources, including the District and Federal Governments,

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>This reporting year has seen continued progress in DC’s 20-year effort to improve the abundance and
                            health of its trees. With an overall grade of A-, we continue to a see strong showing in tree
                            planting, protection and care.
                        </p>
                        <p>Despite the progress, a growing threat, noted in prior report cards, persists: an increasingly large
                            portion of land in DC is covered by impervious surfaces such as concrete and asphalt, compromising
                            the city’s streams and rivers. More of our city is covered with concrete than trees – a trend
                            that will only continue to increase unless we do something now.</p>
                        <p>Given that challenge, this years’ report expands our reach to shed light on how we’re all interconnected,
                            which is why the theme for our current 2019 report is Roots to Rivers. A healthy, robust tree
                            canopy captures and filters rainwater before it enters the drainage system, reduces pollution
                            overflows into the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, and increases D.C.’s resiliency to climate change.
                            With impervious surfaces that continue to increase – trees play a pivotal role in mitigation
                            of climate change and the overall health and resiliency of our city.
                        </p>
                        <p>Roots connect all parts of our environment and, because of this, it is important that we protect
                            not just our trees, but also all parts of our connected ecosystem, such as our soil and our waterways.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>However, with development in the city increasing at a swift pace, the amount of available land that
                            can be used to support our trees and waterways is rapidly declining. And the more the population
                            increases, the more difficult this challenge will become.
                        </p>
                        <p>More than 41 percent of the District’s land is covered by impervious surfaces (like buildings and
                            pavement), and, as this number continues to increase, we must do everything in our power to continue
                            to protect or tree canopy. Without it, our roots and trees, rivers, wildlife, and city as a whole,
                            are at risk.
                        </p>
                        <p>Casey Trees is proud of the support it provides to the City of Trees, but the District needs more
                            - it needs your help! Casey Trees would not be able to accomplish all that it has without your
                            participation and the help of our partners. Through classes, activities, tree care, and advocacy
                            you can help drive our mission to restore, enhance, and protect the tree canopy of the nation’s
                            capital.

                            due to their size, location or other reasons, are being repurposed as perpetual green spaces

                        <p>With cranes and construction a common sight in the District, it’s no secret that D.C. is developing
                            at a rapid pace. New buildings are a visual marker of DC’s growing population, expected to reach
                            1 million people by 2045. Because of this, Mayor Bowser has already made a goal to build 36,000
                            residential housing units by 2025. While more housing is needed to accommodate new and current
                            residents, it also means that impervious surfaces (like buildings and pavement) are growing beginning
                            to replace our city’s green spaces. This creates massive challenges for managing stormwater and
                            the urban heat island, areas that are up to 22 degrees warmer because of impervious surfaces.
                            It also decreases the plantable space we count on to grow tree canopy, and without a growing
                            tree canopy, D.C. loses the vibrancy that makes it such an attractive place to live and work.
                            We must act now to preserve healthy soil, so we can plan for future residents, and for future
                            trees.

                        <p>Washington, D.C. is our home, and our trees provide more than an environmental value, they inspire
                            a sense of place and belonging within our community. From our parks to our shorelines, trees
                            are connection that filters our water, cleans our air, protects our ecosystems, and makes us
                            resilient to the effects of climate change.

                        <p style="text-align:left;">In the past decade, tree planting on both public and private lands has significantly increased through
                            expanded partnerships. </p>

                &nbsp;
                <p style="text-align:left;">For the City to achieve its 40 percent canopy goal by 2032, at least 10,648 trees must be planted each year
                    for the next 14 years. In 2018, 15,529 trees were collectively planted throughout D.C. This vastly surpasses
                    the target and is the highest planting number to date - resulting in an A+ grade.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:left;">Tree Protection metric is an assessment of the effectiveness of the city’s two landmark Tree Protection
                            Laws: the Urban Forest Preservation Act, and its successor – the Tree Canopy Protection Amendment
                            Act of 2016.
                        </p>

                    </article>
                    <article class="col-md-8 align-self-center metric-photo" style="background-image:url('img/protection-photo.PNG'); min-height:395px; max-height: 200px;">

                </div>
                <p style="text-align:left; margin-top: 1rem;">The most significant modification in the 2016 Act was the protection of “Heritage Trees,” those 100 inches
                    in circumference and greater. Over the past year we’re beginning to see the fruits of that legislation,
                    reflected in the caption on this page – the moving of a large oak tree to accommodate a new development.
                    In the past this tree would have been reduced to logs and mulch, but now it will continue mature and
                    thrive through the success of this legislative advancement.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">In judging the success of the city’s efforts to protect trees and replace those that are lost, we look at
                    three sub-metrics identified and described below:
                </p>
                <div class="row" style="padding-top: 1em;">
                    <div class="col-md-4">
                <p style="text-align:left;">
                    <span style="font-weight:600; font-style:italic;">Are the fees and fines levied keeping pace with inflation?</span>
                    <br />Using the Consumer Price Index, we can see that the present-day value of the fees and fines required
                    in the TCPAA have not significantly changed since the law’s passing in May 2016. Therefore, we can award
                    this sub-metric an A grade.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p style="text-align:left;">
                    <span style="font-weight:600; font-style:italic;">Are the replacement trees surviving?</span>
                    <br />Although there are active efforts to replace removed Special Trees, it takes a prolonged maintenance effort to ensure
                    these trees reach full maturity. Trees take time to mature and accrue ecosystem benefits. At twenty years old, trees are providing
                    tehse services. Through our comprehensive longitudinal survival study, 77 percent of the trees planted make it to year twenty. Therefore, 
                    we can award this sub-metric a C+ grade.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p style="text-align:left;">
                    <span style="font-weight:600; font-style:italic;">Are fees and fines being used to plant replacement trees?</span>
                    <br />Per both the Urban Forest Preservation Act of 2002 and the TCPAA, money from the Tree Fund is required
                    to be used to plant trees, therefore, we can assume that the fees and fines are being used to plant replacement
                    trees and we can award this sub-metric an A+ grade.

            <p>
                <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Coverage</span> is a measure of a tree’s crown when viewed from above and is the way we track the progress
                that the District makes towards its 40 percent tree canopy by 2032 goal. The tree crown or canopy produces
                most of the trees overall benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Health</span> encompasses trees condition, species, size and type. This metric helps us understand how
                resilient the District’s trees are in terms of potential threats due to pests and diseases. It can also predict
                the longevity and future composition of D.C.’s trees.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Planting</span> is a count of annual tree planting numbers compared to the total number of trees that
                must be planted per year to achieve the city’s 40% canopy goal by 2032.</p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Protection</span> refers to the preservation of trees on a site undergoing construction. This metric
                considers removing, relocating and replacing trees and their impact on the 40% goal.
